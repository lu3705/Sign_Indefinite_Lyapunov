# Sign_Indefinite_Lyapunov
This repository includes the code developed during my internship project focused on the stability analysis of continuous and discrete-time systems with input saturation. The study uses Lyapunov functions with sign-indefinite quadratic forms and applies Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) to verify both global and regional stability.
