# Sign-Indefinite Lyapunov

This repository contains the code developed during my internship project focused on the stability analysis and control synthesis of discrete-time systems with input saturation. For comparison and validation, the continuous-time examples presented in the reference work [1] were also replicated.

The study is based on Lyapunov functions with sign-indefinite quadratic forms and uses Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) to first assess both global and regional stability. Then, the same framework is extended to synthesize a stabilizing controller under both global and regional conditions.
